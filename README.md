PRUnderground challenge
A few considerations.
In order to get the popup present in all the pages I used the theme editor (active theme: twentytwenty two) and I placed the shortcode in the footer of the theme as depicted in the screenshot sent by email
As the design was presented as an image I wasn't able to replicate it exactly the color and the font family.
The font is an approximation and also the color of the submit button.
